        <h2>The Stark House</h2>
        <p>In Game of Thrones, House Stark is a noble house in Westeros and the royal house of the North. They are known for their honor, benevolence, and upholding the rule of law. 
            House Stark's history dates back thousands of years, with their founder Brandon the Builder raising Winterfell and building the Wall. In days of old, they ruled as Kings of Winter, but since Aegon's Conquest they have been Wardens of the North and ruled as Lords of Winterfell. The bran Stark that we know from the series is named after Brandon Stark, also known as Bran the Builder.</p>
