        <h2>The Stark House</h2>
        <p>In Game of Thrones, House Stark is a noble house in Westeros and the royal house of the North. They are known for their honor, benevolence, and upholding the rule of law. 
            House Stark's history dates back thousands of years, with their founder Brandon the Builder raising Winterfell and building the Wall. In days of old, they ruled as Kings of Winter, but since Aegon's Conquest they have been Wardens of the North and ruled as Lords of Winterfell. The bran Stark that we know from the series is named after Brandon Stark, also known as Bran the Builder.</p>

        <h3>Personality Traits of Stark</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Starks are known for being cold, serious, and bleak.This has often been attributed to them living in the cold of the North, but it is actually a pessimism that keeps them grounded in reality. 
            </li>
            <li>The Starks are also known for their stoicism and strength in adversity. Their sigil is a grey direwolf on a white background, over a green escutcheon, capturing the family's readiness for the hardship of winter and the struggle to stay alive. Their family motto is "Winter is Coming", a warning that no matter the circumstances will always be relevant. 
            </li>
            <li>The Starks have a reputation for long faces, brown hair, and grey eyes. Some are known for melancholy and iciness, while others have a wildness sometimes called "wolf blood".</li>
